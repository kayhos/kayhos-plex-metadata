Repository for artwork, metadata and collection files for PMM

## Metadata

Definition of specific posters for movies, tv series and anime.
Sometimes, I have specified a date and alt_title when Plex is wonky.

## Collections

Multiple types of collections:

- Awards
- Charts & Top
- Collections (for example: 1001 movies to see before you die)
- Directed By ...
- Genre (TV: Plex, Movies: Plex, Anime: MAL)
- Holidays
- Studios and Networks

## Overlays

Language overlays for English, French and Japanese are added thanks to Cpt Kuesel on the PMM Discord.

Also, 4k & HDR overlays are added, anything below this will not get a resolution tag.
